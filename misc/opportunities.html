<h1>Opportunities in the Workforce​</h1>
<p>Some benefits such as there being no biased decision-making involved when used for employing new people, as the AI used in these situations is programmed to read people. For example, the AI could be monitoring their behaviour during their interviews, such as their confidence, and basing it off the answers given in the interview rather than the interviewer being biased. There is also enhanced efficiency in the workplace, as AI does not need breaks and will continue to work until the task at hand is completed. This means that the duties and tasks given to the AI are completed much faster compared to a regular human employee. AI’s also enhance safety in the workplace, as they can be programmed to detect hazards in the area they’re in, such as a wet floor or if someone's behaviour is causing risk to other people, where the AI would report to management. These opportunities are definitely a bonus for large companies as they would save a large amount of money as well as an increase in efficiency.  Though this does not mean there are no risks/disadvantages.
