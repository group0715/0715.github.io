<h1>The Impact of AI on Jobs</h1>
<p><em>With the use of AI becoming more commonly seen around the world, we have taken an interest in the use of AI in the workplace. Specifically in the USA, due to them having massive companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft at the front of AI-driven research.“Their goal: to become a major player in an industry that is expected to reach upwards of $118 billion by 2025.“. With AI becoming widely recognised around the world, the US is already implementing artificial intelligence into their workplace. “Large employers are already using some form of artificial intelligence in employment decision-making. A February 2022 survey from the Society of Human Resources Management found that 79% of employers use A.I. and/or automation for recruitment and hiring.”(Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to make workplace decisions–but human intelligence remains vital). With AI being implemented into the workplace it poses risks and benefits/opportunities.  ​</p></em>
